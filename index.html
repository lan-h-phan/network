This is going to be an attempt to make a game learning from Nicky Case's design.

We will see how this goes.

<!-- Introduction -->
<!--
TRANSLATE note: to make the text stay in a circle, I added lots of <br> breaks.
You may have to re-arrange the <br>'s in order to do your translation.
It shouldn't look too bad if they're slightly off, though!
Also, <b></b> bolds a word/phrase, and <i></i> italicizes a word/phrase.

<words id="intro">

	<br><br>

	Sir Isaac Newton was pretty sure he was a
	<br>
	smart cookie. I mean, after inventing calculus and
	<br>
	a theory of gravity, he should be clever enough to do
	<br>
	some financial investing, right? Anyway, long story short, he
	<br>
	lost $4,600,000 (in today's dollars) in the nationwide
	<br>
	speculation frenzy known as the South Sea Bubble of 1720.

	<br><br>

	As Mr. Newton later said: <i>“I can calculate the motion of
	<br>
	heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.”</i>

	<next>yeah sucks for him <div class="rarr"></div> </next>

</words>

<words id="intro_2">

	<div style="height:0.5em"></div>

	Of course, that's not the only
	<br>
	time markets, institutions, or entire
	<br>
	democracies went haywire &mdash; the <i>madness</i> of
	<br>
	crowds. And yet, just when you lose hope in humanity,
	<br>
	you see citizens coordinating to rescue each other in
	<br>
	hurricanes, communities creating solutions to problems,
	<br>
	people fighting for a better world &mdash; the <i>wisdom</i> of crowds!

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	<b>But <i>why</i> do some crowds turn to madness, or wisdom?</b> No theory
	<br>
	can explain everything, but I think a new field of study,
	<br>
	<b>network science</b>, can guide us! And its core idea is this: to
	<br>
	understand crowds, we should look not at the <i>individual
	<br>
	people</i>, but at...

	<next>...their <i>connections.</i> <div class="rarr"></div> </next>

</words>

<!-- Networks -->

<words id="networks_tutorial_start">
	<b>Let's draw a network!</b>
	Each connection represents a friendship between two people:
</words>

<words id="networks_tutorial_connect">
	draw to connect
</words>

<words id="networks_tutorial_disconnect">
	scratch to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disconnect
</words>

<words id="networks_tutorial_end">

	when you're done doodling and playing around,
	<next wiggle>let's continue <div class="rarr"></div> </next>

</words>

<words id="networks_threshold">

	Now, social connections are for more than just making pretty pictures.
	People <i>look to</i> their social connections to understand their world.
	For example, people look to their peers to
	find out <b>what % of their friends (not counting themselves)</b> are,
	say, binge-drinkers. <icon name="yellow"></icon>

</words>

<words id="networks_threshold_instruction">
	<b>Draw/erase connections, and see what happens! <div class="rarr"></div> </b>
</words>

<words id="networks_threshold_end">
	<next>cool, got it</next>
</words>

<words id="networks_pre_puzzle">
	However, networks can <i>fool</i> people.
	Just like how the earth seems flat because we're on it,
	people may get wrong ideas about society because they're <i>in</i> it.
</words>

<words id="optional_reading">
	<div style="position:absolute; top:5px;">
		<i>optional</i> extra bonus notes! &uarr;
	</div>
	<div style="position:absolute; left:216px; top:10px;">
		&darr; links and references
	</div>
</words>

<words id="networks_pre_puzzle_2">
	
	<bon id="books"></bon>

	<br>

	For example, a 1991 study<ref id="drunk"></ref> showed that 
	“virtually all [college] students reported that their friends drank more than they did.”
	But that seems impossible!
	How can that be?
	Well, you're about to invent the answer yourself, by drawing a network.
	It's time to...

	<next>FOOL EVERYONE <div class="rarr"></div> </next>

</words>

<words id="networks_puzzle">

	<b style="font-size:2em">PUZZLE TIME!</b>
	<br>
	Fool <i>everyone</i> into thinking
	the majority of their friends (50% threshold) are binge-drinkers <icon name="yellow"></icon>
	(even though binge-drinkers are outnumbered 2-to-1!)

</words>
<words id="networks_puzzle_metric">
	<b>FOOLED:</b>
</words>
<words id="networks_puzzle_metric_2">
	out of 9 people
</words>
<words id="networks_puzzle_end">
	Congrats! You manipulated a group of students into believing
	in the prevalance of an incredibly unhealthy social norm! Good going!
	<next wiggle>...uh. thanks?</next>
</words>

<words id="networks_post_puzzle">

	What you just created is called The Majority Illusion<ref id="majority"></ref>,
	which also explains why people think their political views are consensus,
	or why extremism seems more common than it actually is.
	<i>Madness.</i>

	<bon id="connections"></bon>

	But people don't just passively <i>observe</i> others' ideas and behaviors,
	they actively <i>copy</i> them.
	So now, let's look at something network scientists call...

	<next>“Contagions!” <div class="rarr"></div> </next>
